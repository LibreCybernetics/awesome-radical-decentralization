## Projects

### Decentralized applications

#### FileSharing

* [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/)  
OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size.

#### Hosting

* [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/)  
Beaker is a peer-to-peer browser with tools to create and host websites. Don't just browse the Web, build it.

* [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/)  
Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it less vulnerable to attack, and if used in "darknet" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect.

* [TickTack](https://github.com/ticktackim/ticktack-workplan)  
A blog publishing app for long-form articles. Also has private messaging integrated.

* [Patchbay](https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay)  
The goal is to make a client developers love - it comes with social views, as well as chess, book reviews, and some git interface.

* [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork)  
A decentralized messaging and sharing app built using patchcore. The goal is to make a standalone, easy to install, "social" view into the SSB world.

#### VPN Services

* [wireguard VPN Tunnel](https://www.wireguard.com/)  
Fast, modern , encrypted  general purpose VPN Tunnel. Open Source.

#### Developer Tools
* [git-ssb](https://git-ssb.celehner.com/%25n92DiQh7ietE%2BR%2BX%2FI403LQoyf2DtR3WQfCkDKlheQU%3D.sha256)  
A totally decent git interface. Familiar interface for raising issues, forking, opening pull requests. News about projects of friends, or people you follow.

### Industry

#### General

* [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/)  
We’re developing open source industrial machines that can be made for a fraction of commercial costs, and sharing our designs online for free. The goal of Open Source Ecology is to create an open source economy – an efficient economy which increases innovation by open collaboration.


#### Houses & Buildings
